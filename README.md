## Ground Station Specific Considerations

### Mission-Critical Timing

Ground Station operations are often time-sensitive with narrow contact windows. Consider:

- **Contact Window Optimization**: Ensure systems can handle peak loads during satellite passes
- **Real-time Processing**: Evaluate requirements for real-time vs. batch processing
- **Backup Procedures**: Plan for alternative processing if primary systems fail during critical contacts

### Data Volume and Velocity

Satellite data can vary dramatically in volume and arrival patterns:

- **Burst Processing**: Design systems to handle sudden large data influxes
- **Storage Tiering**: Implement appropriate storage classes for different data retention needs
- **Bandwidth Planning**: Ensure adequate network capacity for data transfer requirements

### Regulatory Compliance

Many Ground Station operations have strict regulatory requirements:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensure data remains in appropriate geographic regions
- **Export Controls**: Implement controls for ITAR and EAR compliance
- **Audit Requirements**: Maintain detailed logs for compliance reporting

### Integration Complexity

Ground Station systems often integrate with multiple external systems:

- **Legacy Systems**: Plan for integration with existing ground infrastructure
- **Third-party APIs**: Consider reliability and security of external dependencies
- **Data Format Standards**: Ensure compatibility with industry-standard formats
